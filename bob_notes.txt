  - console complains about Authors.render() not returning a valid ReactComponent, but I'm having a hard time finding it
- authorApi at http://bit.ly/authorapi
- got Authors to render by rerunning the video & retyping the code; I might go & look at the diff later

- was able to sort out why the header wasn't rendering after adding the about section
  - had forgotten to take out the render statement at the end of main.js
  - figured it out because no matter what I did to the App class in main.js, it still rendered the Home, effectively ignoring the App class
  - once the render statement was removed, all worked as expected

HTML in JS: A Justification
- he makes a number of good points justifying the seeming "mixing of concerns" in that other frameworks essentially put JS in HTML but React does the reverse, the benefit being that errors are easier to spot and fix, since JS is less tolerant of errors and when an error occurs, it's explicit about where the error occurs.
