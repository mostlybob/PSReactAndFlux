  - DefaultRoute - For URL of "/". Like "index.html"
  - NotFoundRoute - Client-side 404
  - Redirect - redirect to another route
- Demo: Route Configuration	
- Demo: Bootstrapping
  - interesting comment about using a directive instead of "use strict" to suspend linting: /*eslint-disable strict*/
  - some trouble with the defined routes; his are fine, but mine are complaining about not being able to find the author & about components:
  { [Error: Cannot find module './components/authorPage' from '/home/bob/workspace/react/coryhouse_ps/src']
  stream: 
		...

	- it looks like the additional path specifier is missing 
	- yep, I goofed the routes.js file & omitted the path to components
	- fixed linting errors, but still doesn't show
	  - JS console is showing a couple of errors

- still having trouble with the Authors page rendering
  - console complains about Authors.render() not returning a valid ReactComponent, but I'm having a hard time finding it
- authorApi at http://bit.ly/authorapi
- got Authors to render by rerunning the video & retyping the code; I might go & look at the diff later
	- commit id e82c9b3

- reviewing: Demo: Simple Routing
  - immediately invoked function expression (IIFE - "iffy")

- was able to sort out why the header wasn't rendering after adding the about section
  - had forgotten to take out the render statement at the end of main.js
  - figured it out because no matter what I did to the App class in main.js, it still rendered the Home, effectively ignoring the App class
  - once the render statement was removed, all worked as expected

HTML in JS: A Justification
- he makes a number of good points justifying the seeming "mixing of concerns" in that other frameworks essentially put JS in HTML but React does the reverse, the benefit being that errors are easier to spot and fix, since JS is less tolerant of errors and when an error occurs, it's explicit about where the error occurs.

-installed Babel and Babel snippets packages for sublime
