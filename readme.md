This my read-along for the Pluralsight course [Building Applications with React and Flux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-flux-building-applications/table-of-contents) by [Cory House](http://www.bitnative.com/). 

I only got on the ball about keeping notes a little way into the course and keeping a git repo later than that, so the early commits are a bit uneven in schedule & scope. Hopefully, that got/gets better as time goes on. If you take the course, you *may* find something of use here. It's not necessarily for public consumption, but feel free to take what you want. We're all in this together. :-)
